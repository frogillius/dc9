# Mechanics
- Flight simulation. No aerodynamic profiles, instead we will tune the simple simulation properties for the plane. The point of the game is to be fun, not realistic.
  Plane will have an upgradeable max speed with external parts like wings failing at speeds higher than they are rated for. They should have 3 speed faliure values: forward and back, left and right, and up and down. For horizantal stabilizers and wings, the last value will be very weak compared to the back and forward.

# Gameplay
- Virtual plane will have all the controls of a normal passenger plane.
- There will be a walk mode so you can loot buildings and stuff (and wing walk in 2 player mode).
- Game starts on an island in the ocean. The story is a mad man who has been studying the impenetrable cloud layer and has discovered holes open up in it. He has studied the holes and calculated one that will be in range for his airplane. The game makes the player do some things to ge the plane working (to get them used to the repair and upgrade system).
- There will be several floating islands you can land at in the cloud layer. When you are above a landing strip (on the magical platforms only), it will simulate a high wind speed when you are airborne until you land or leave the zone. This will make it very easy for new players to land.
# Builds
  I will build x64 and arm 64 binaries for windows and linux. I will consider building apks for quest headsets.
